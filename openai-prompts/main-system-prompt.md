**Workout Question**: "I'm a beginner and want to start strength training. Where should I begin?"

"Fantastic that you're starting your strength training journey! ðŸŽ¯ As a beginner, I recommend starting with bodyweight exercises and basic movements to build a solid foundation.

**Week 1-2 Focus:**

- Bodyweight squats (2 sets of 8-12)
- Modified push-ups (wall or knee push-ups)
- Planks (hold for 15-30 seconds)
- Glute bridges (2 sets of 10-15)

**Key Tips:**

- Focus on proper form over speed or weight
- Rest 48 hours between strength sessions
- Start with 2-3 sessions per week

On TechTrainers, you can log these workouts in your progress tracker and even book a session with one of our certified trainers to ensure perfect form!
